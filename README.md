## 📂 Projects

Here are some of my notable data science projects:

1. **[Pizza Sales Analytics ](Project_Link)** 

Overview:
This project aims to analyze pizza sales data to gain valuable insights into various aspects of the business, including total revenue, top-selling pizzas, sales distribution by pizza size, sales by month, day, and hour, and identifying peak sales times.

Data Sources:
1. Sales data: Transaction records with details of each pizza order, including pizza type, size, quantity, and timestamp.
2. Pizza menu data: Information on pizza types and their prices.
3. Calendar data: To track months, days, and hours for analysis.

Key Analysis Goals:

1. Total Revenue:
   - Calculate the total revenue generated over a specific time period.

2. Order by Revenue:
   - Identify the highest revenue-generating orders (e.g., large pizzas or multiple pizzas).

3. Pizza Size by Revenue:
   - Determine which pizza sizes contribute the most to revenue.

4. Sales Distribution:
   - Analyze sales trends, including daily, monthly, and hourly sales.

5. Top Sales with Type of Pizza:
   - Identify the best-selling pizza types and their contribution to overall sales.

6. Percentage of Pizza Sales:
   - Calculate the percentage of sales each pizza type contributes to the total.

7. Month-wise Pizza Sales:
   - Analyze monthly sales trends to identify seasonality or monthly variations.

8. Day-wise Pizza Sales:
   - Examine daily sales patterns to understand which days of the week are busiest.

9. Hour-wise Pizza Sales:
   - Determine peak hours for pizza sales.

10. Most Pizzas Sold:
    - Identify the time, day, and month when the highest number of pizzas are sold.

Tools and Technologies:
- Data analysis and visualization tools (e.g., Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- Database management system for storing and retrieving sales data.
- Excel or Google Sheets for basic data manipulation and visualization.
- Power BI or Tableau for creating interactive dashboards.

Project Deliverables:
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation: Cleaning and formatting raw data for analysis.
2. Data Analysis: Performing the specified analyses to answer key questions.
3. Visualization: Creating graphs, charts, and interactive dashboards to present findings.
4. Insights Report: Summarizing key insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

Outcome:
This project will provide the pizza business with valuable insights into its sales patterns, helping them optimize pricing, pizza sizes, and promotional strategies. Additionally, it will enable the business to better allocate resources during peak hours, days, and months, ultimately increasing profitability and customer satisfaction.
